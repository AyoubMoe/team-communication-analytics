Project Overview

This project demonstrates how communication patterns within software development teams can be analyzed to identify early indicators of declining confidence and collaboration.

The dashboard prototype combines communication efficiency metrics and collaboration survey indicators to show how team behavior relates to problem-solving confidence. It is designed as a concept for instructors, team leads, or managers who want early visibility into team health.

This portfolio project showcases end-to-end data analytics workflow:

defining a problem

structuring a dataset

modeling relationships

building a dashboard

presenting insights

Problem

Instructors and team leads often struggle to detect when teams are losing confidence until performance drops. By the time issues become visible, it is usually late in the project cycle.

This project explores whether communication behaviors can act as early warning signals.

Goal

Build a prototype analytics dashboard that:

tracks team communication efficiency

measures collaboration indicators

visualizes relationships with confidence

highlights teams that may need support

Dataset

The dataset used in this demo was reconstructed from the structure and findings of the original capstone research project.

It includes the following variables:

Variable	Description
Team	Team identifier
Efficiency	Ratio of solutions proposed to problems raised
OK_Count	Agreement markers in discussions
Sentiment	Average sentiment score from communication
Collaboration	Survey-based collaboration rating
Confidence	Self-reported problem-solving confidence

The dataset is included in this repository for demonstration purposes.

Key Insights

Higher collaboration strongly predicts higher team confidence

Teams with efficient communication show more positive sentiment

Combined metrics can help identify struggling teams early

Dashboard illustrates how analytics could support proactive intervention

Tools Used

Tableau Public (dashboard visualization)

Excel / CSV data structuring

Research-driven metric design

Data storytelling and visualization

Dashboard Features

Scatter plot showing collaboration vs confidence

Efficiency vs sentiment relationship

Team comparison metrics

Clean product-style layout for stakeholder use

This dashboard is designed to resemble an internal analytics tool rather than a static academic report.
